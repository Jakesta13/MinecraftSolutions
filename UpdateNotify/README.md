# UpdateNotify
This script will allow you to send HTTP requests to IFTTT to notify whoever wherever when there is a new update for minecraft.
I made this because Mojang has recently REMOVED their RSS feed from the minecraft website.

## To-Do
* Allow user to choose to use manual CURL over IFTTT, currently having problems nesting IF statements.
* Allow selection to choose which versions to get notified for (Released only, Snapshots only, or both)
